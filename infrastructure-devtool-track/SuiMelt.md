## Project Description 
- SuiMelt is Sui's first NFT marketplace powered by its premier Automated Market
Maker (AMM) protocol designed specifically for trading pools and price
discovery functions for NFT assets.

- Using customizable bonding curves, it facilitates the exchange of NFTs for tokens (and vice versa). Liquidity providers (LPs) can deposit assets into single-sided buy or sell pools, or into dual-sided trade pools which buy and sell NFTs with an optional spread to capture trading fees.
- Users trade with NFT liquidity pools instead of directly trading between themselves.
